# ShodanSpider

**ShodanSpider** is a powerful and easy-to-use tool designed for interacting with Shodan data. It allows users to search and analyze Shodan’s vast database of internet-connected devices without the need for an API key (though a key can be used for enhanced results). The tool is perfect for cybersecurity researchers, penetration testers, and anyone interested in scanning and analyzing devices connected to the internet.

## Features

- **Free and Open Source**: No API key is required for basic use. You can get limited results with Shodan's free tier.
- **Enhanced Search**: Use your Shodan API key for premium access and more detailed results.
- **Flexible**: Supports saving search results to an output file for later analysis.
- **Customizable**: Set a timeout for searches and adjust other options easily.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

To run ShodanSpider, you need to have the following installed:

- **bash** (for running the script)
- **curl** (for making HTTP requests)

### Steps to Install

## Usage

Once installed, you can use **ShodanSpider** directly from the terminal with the following options:

### Options

- `-q <query>`: Shodan search query (e.g., `apache`, `ssl`, etc.).
